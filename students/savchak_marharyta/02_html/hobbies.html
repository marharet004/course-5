    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <p>
        I'm a very multifaceted person.Lot's of things make my stomach <br>
        full of butterflies. For example art. All kinds of art is amazing. <br>
        Singing and dancing help me to find who i trully am. I feel connected <br>
        to my body and fully in charge of it. Also i can tell you about my <br>
        love to painting. I was attending an art school for three years and <br>
        it showed me that visual art can make people feel things that i feel, <br>
        with it i can express myself, i can create my own reality. One more <br>
        important hobby for me is videomaking. I like to take part in all stages <br>
        of this activity, from making a script to editing. I like that activity <br>
        because i can show other people my point of view. I can throw them in <br>
        atmosphere, wich i made, and make them think about lot's of important <br>
        questions.<br>
